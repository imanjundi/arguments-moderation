While return on investment will vary considerably depending on how individuals / businesses utilize the data, ultimately the benefits are certainly there. My argument is not with the regulation, rather the implementation. Having implemented many GPS solutions over the last several years I am aware of the investment numerous small and medium size companies have made. I work with businesses to find the solution that meets their objectives so I am familiar with several solutions. For the most part, businesses invested in GPS to ensure efficient dispatching, monitoring activity, and provide accurate customer service. The objective was not regulatory compliance as it was not mandated at time of purchase. That now changes and in almost all cases my customers now have tracking devices that will become obsolete. Not in functionality, but in compliance. Where is their relief in the mandatory re-investment? Many have yet to reach ROI. As a new investment, I am not hearing much push back. However, for those that have recently invested in the technology but find their respective solution non-compliant is painful. It certainly provides transport data that satisfied their objectives at the time, but the providers did not intend for their market to be subject to regulations that require data that they are unable to capture. There should be some credit available to those businesses that already have tracking capabilities.	5	5	4	5	4.75

What about this information? ATA announced that in an effort to rationalize a change in federal Hours of Service (HOS) requirements for professional truck drivers, the U.S. DOT's Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) misapplied its own crash numbers so as to elevate driver fatigue as a cause of truck crashes.

The manufacturers of these devices are the one's really pushing them - just follow the money trail. If any company wants to use EOBRs let them have at it, but to mandate such a device on a small operation will put that small operation at an even more cost disadvantage. People Net wants $1500 per device and $60 per month service fee. Small operations are already at a huge disadvantage with respect to fuel costs. We cannot come near the fuel discounts that the big boys get. EOBRS are a tool that should not be forced upon anybody unless they demonstrate that they cannot provide accurate and truthful logs and supporting documentation.

914.0_Airline Passenger Rights	True	3.804639	2.6964793	2.5895648	2.8961983	Let's keep in mind that a bumped passenger may miss a cruise ship departure, miss a connecting flight, lose a day (or sometimes more) of a prepaid vacation, or miss a wedding or funeral because the airline was greedy and didn't want even one empty seat on their flight. If being bumped from a flight caused additional problems for the bumped passenger(s) then the passenger(s) should be able to submit proof of loss and the airline should have to compensate WITHOUT LIMIT in addition to the proposed penalties. I also like the idea of pre notification of bumping. It can cost well over $100 to get to an airport (for example, central NJ to JFK is about $150 and for a long vacation this is cheaper than airport parking). When a passenger is bumped and the next available flight is the next day this can mean an additional $300+ in travel costs.	5	5	5	4	4.75

We must understand that other governments may not view these rules as being benign and could very well impose restrictions on US carriers. Beware the law of unforeseen consequences. The tarmac delay problem is not caused by airlines, and in particular foreign airlines. To submit them to significant operational or financial consequences because of something outside of their control doesn't seem appropriate. Lets not forget the tarmac delay problem is the fault of the FAA and airports, allowing over scheduling and not restricting slots. Eurocontrol (the FAA's equivalent) directs European airports to implement flow-control restrictions whenever an airport (or airspace) cannot provide it's expected capacity. When this happens airlines have to reduce their flights in proportion to the total number of slots they 'own' at that airport. In the US when 'stuff' happens it becomes the airlines problem and they have to sort it out themselves. (competition law prohibits them from discussing solutions with their competitors). Let's fix the problem, not the symptoms.	5	4	4	5	4.5

Why should we pay the cost for some alien device to be planted in our vehicle, at our expense, to be used against us as an enforcement tool? This is no more than Big Brother overstepping his sovereign authority. We did not place sovereignty in our government to merely penalize us for making a living, while they fatten their pockets from all of the public lobbyists groups. Fire/Layoff unneeded law enforcement, pay for these devices yourself. We already pay: for trucks, trailers, all maintenance, registration, authority, process agents, IFTA Stickers, UCR (another subject that erks me), 2290 Highway Road Use, Fuel Taxes, Ad Valorem Tax, fuel and supplement purchases, insurance, Drug Consortium, ungodly enforcement penalties (sometimes by crooked law enforcement that never even crawl under your vehicle, but charge you with brakes out of adjustment), forced to keep extensive records and documentation, income taxes (federal and state), self-employment tax, health physicals, cost of cash flow, and many other numerous things. And don't forget: We have been informed of the proposed 1099's that we must issue to EVERYONE that we do $600 in business with in a year. It takes so much time for all of that, that we really don't have time to drive now.

876.0_Airline Passenger Rights	True	3.7599494	2.2682366	2.1996822	2.5402155	I believe airlines should be forced to fully reimburse confirmed passengers whenever the airline changes flight schedules after booking. I frequently reserve flights up to one year in advance, in order to secure the lowest price and best seat. I do this even though the airline will charge me $150 (plus fare difference) to change my itinerary for personal reasons once booked. However, the airline frequently change flight schedules for confirmed passengers without compensation, nor consideration of passengers' plans. For example, a trip to Europe on United Airlines has now been changed 7 times by the airline since I confirmed my reservation in December 2009. The resulting changes have added nearly 5 hours to the total trip, plus I'm now required to leave at 3AM for the airport (instead of my original departure of 8AM), and I return after midnight, rather than a more reasonable 10:30PM. In addition, United Airlines has not offered to waive the change fee, nor provide seats on alternate dates or airline partners. If I'm required to pay exorbitant fees to the airlines to change my original itinerary, due to personal circumstances, then the airlines should also be required to compensate inconvenienced passengers in full AND provide satisfactory alternate travel arrangements comparable to the original flight schedule. Perhaps this would force the airlines to recognize the hardships they create for passengers when schedules are revised after passengers have already received confirmed flights and make related travel arrangements.	5	5	5	4	4.75

In general the airlines average what a ""typical"" load of baggage and people weighs and how much that adds to the amount of fuel required for a flight. They do not weigh each aircraft prior to take off so you don't have any good numbers to back up the need for a fee for more bags or for heavier people. If you want to charge based on weight then everyone on a flight that is not full should get a refund since the airline is carrying far less weight if the plane is half full right? And how about if the majority of people on the flight are smaller than ""average""? Should they all get refunds as well? What if I only bring a light carry on and you check a 30 pound suitcase, should I get a discount or should you pay more? (I weigh 250 lbs) Or...should it all just be averaged out among all of the passengers like it is now? as for the disclosure...yes, airlines should disclose what it costs to take a flight with them and it should be easy to find, read and understand. After that it's up to the customer to actually find and read it before they pay for it."	3	4	5	3	3.75
334.0_Airline Passenger Rights	True	3.7744608	2.3887885	2.3099215	2.6281767	I do not think there should be a compensation cap. If a passenger is bumped from a flight and misses an important business meeting, high school graduation or wedding, there is no price that can compensate for that. Certainly not $1300. In addition, even if the entire flight fare is refunded (easily over $1300 on some long overseas flights), there are other costs that the bumped passenger could face such as non-refundable/prepaid hotel reservations or other travel and travel related expenses. If a passenger can prove that he or she has additional expense above and beyond what the airline offers and the government requires he or she should be awarded more compensation. As for zero-fare tickets, for the same reasons above, I do not think compensating them with just miles is adequate. Volunteering: I am happy to volunteer if there is some sort of compensation and I am not in a huge rush or too inconvenienced. I was especially happy to do so when a group of 50+ school students needed to get onboard together to fly from London to Dallas but the airline messed up. Volunteer opportunities and compensation should be posted/announced when one checks in (online, at terminal, etc.) and continue to be posted and announced for all to see/hear until the last minute and the airline has to bump involuntarily.	5	5	5	4	4.75
607.0_Airline Passenger Rights	True	3.2676167	2.5662472	2.5328202	2.8903868	Are we talking about airlines not providing peanuts, or peanuts not being allowed on an airplane? These are two VERY different issues. I would be indifferent to rules preventing airlines from serving peanuts (actually, I would welcome it, because I like the crackers better!). People who want peanuts can bring their own, easily enough. Should people be banned from bringing their own peanuts? No. And honestly, people would be more effective using market forces to convince airlines to change their menus. I do have a cousin who legitimately goes into anaphylactic shock at exposure to peanuts. It's not a joking matter; I would guess we have fewer complications because people with peanut issues don't fly. But this is a minority, and I would not support a ban on peanuts existing on an airplane. but do we really need airlines to serve peanuts? This reaction isn't actually about peanuts at all.	2	3	4	3	3.0

I know that many times the airlines can't also know exactly when a weather hold or a maintenance issue will be rectified and that the flight is then ready to go. Many time it can be surprisingly faster than expected. The problem is that some flyers may then wait before going to the airport, but then find that the problem was rectified sooner than expected and the flight departed. Of course the flyer and the flyers rights organization will then crucify the airlines for such poor planning. Flyers need to grow up and quit pouting and blaming everthing on the airlines.

Smaller aircraft do need compensation, however it should be based on what the alternative travel options are. Typically, a smaller connecting flight will be either close to home, or close to the destination, where the traveler may want to opt for a rental car or taxi instead. Zero-fare tickets may not need monetary compensation, as they did not pay out of pocket for the flight, but in addition to being re-booked, the miles or points redeemed should be credited back to the account. It would not be fair for people using zero-fare tickets to walk out with cash-in-hand. The biggest issue with overbooking is that people are not informed of their options. The full flight information is not disclosed when the ""next flight"" time is given. I would like to see a printed overbooking/bumping policy at the agent counter available, as well as the agents being up front with the customers when asking for volunteers, such as, ""We are overbooked by 7 passengers. We are looking for volunteers, etc..."" My recent experience with an overbooking, they were looking for volunteers, and I hesitated because I saw a few people already list their names.

963.0_Airline Passenger Rights	True	3.5551705	2.7789173	2.6282063	2.9117084	Several of the reasons cited for delays are air traffic control and late arriving aircraft. Air traffic in a couple key spots in this country is congested, in part, because airlines are flying more smaller planes rather than fewer larger planes - to carry the same amount of passengers. This takes up more landing slots. Why do they do this? 1) Planes are charged landing fees based on weight, and therefore it can be cheaper to land 2 smaller, lighter planes rather than one larger, heavier plane. 2) Airlines are worried that if they swap out 2 lighter planes for 1 heavier plane, then another airline will come in and take the landing slot and offer an extra flight of its own and siphon off passengers. Airlines worry that if they don't offer the most frequent flights, packed especially into the most desired times for business travelers, their competition will. This leads to an inefficient bunching of many flights on somewhat smaller planes at peak times, leading to congestion and delays. The government should change the basis on which landing fees are calculated as a start toward dis-incentivizing these practices. 1) The landing fees should not be based primarily on weight, but rather should be based on the fact that the plane is using a landing slot, with only some consideration given to the weight of the aircraft. That would encourage airlines to choose larger planes that can carry more people with less per-person environmental impact and fewer overall landing slots, reducing delays. 2) The landing fees should be somewhat greater at peak times of day to encourage airlines to spread out their flights more, thereby reducing congestion and delays.	5	5	4	5	4.75

I think it would be easier on the airlines to either never have peanuts, or use something else when someone with an allergy is flying. A bubble around the person(s) puts too much responsibility on the flight crew that has other things to worry about. Since people could be switched to a flight at the last minute, and changing snacks already loaded could be a problem, I suspect this would just ban peanuts completely. While I agree that people with allergies should be ready to deal with problems, I do not consider telling people with severe problems to just not fly to be reasonable. Taking a boat to other continents is not a reasonable option, nor is keeping people from visiting them.	4	4	4	3	3.75

Like anyone who has an anaphylactic allergy, I always carry my epi-pen and benedryl everywhere I go. I always get nervous when flying at the thought of going into anaphylactic shock mid-air, and believe that something needs to be done to protect people with true food allergies. I think to start, serving peanuts should be banned. The degree of the allergy varies from person to person, but banning the actual product would help a lot of people right away. Food that might be shared on the same equipment or may contain nuts should still be allowed to respect the other side's rights. I also think there should be peanut free seating on planes that are priority to people with allergies. That would eliminate the chance of my neighbor eating nuts. It's a tough subject to debate. Maybe airlines should ask when purchasing a ticket as to whether or not they are traveling with someone who has an allergy. Based on answers, they can then plan for seating accordingly. Some baseball stadiums have peanut free sections, and airplanes should too!	4	5	5	4	4.5

Banning future peanuts doesn't change that cross-contamination is already in place and it's already a life-threatening environment. What is the solution... replace all aircrafts? Not feasible. I, too, suffer from a life-threatening food allergy; but I do not expect the world to change for me. I adjust to the world; if I think there's a chance that I will be exposed to my food ""poison,"" I don't go there. It's inconvenient and sometimes a hardship for me, but I'm the one with the allergy. Unfortunately, there are no guarantees in this world. Even if peanuts are banned, what is to prevent one passenger from having a bag on his/her person and coming aboard? Will that person be criminally charged if someone has a reaction? Will they be sued? Probably. The problem is that banning peanuts alone won't make life on a plane safer; it'll only be as safe as fellow passengers or airline staff taking precautions for the risk and, frankly, those who don't have or know anyone who has life-threatening allergies have no idea how easily cross-contamination can occur. As someone with such an allergy, there's no way I would place my trust for my life on strangers to take precautions for my allergy. Banning isn't a real solution; finding a cure is."	2	3	5	4	3.5

If we were in pre-regulation days where an airline was making money with only 60% of the seats filled, flights canceling due to the 3 hour limit would not be much of a problem. What is a problem is flights that are now being canceled because of the new rule and virtually no seats available on subsequent flights to accommodate those passengers. If the ground delays are due to ATC, weather, VIP movement (president in the area) then passengers will not be, as a rule, given cancellation perks since they are beyond the control of the company. If the air conditioning, and restrooms are functioning properly and there are plenty of beverages and snacks on board then that maximum number of hours should be flexible. I would be curious to hear from people that had their flight cancel due to the 3 hour limit and how the airlines handled them after that. My guess this rule will cause greater damage to air travel then the occasional extended ground hold on an airplane with poor air conditioning or non-functioning lavatories. Here is my question...if the airplane is comfortable and exceeding the 3 hour limit would cancel the flight with no hotel or meal compensation, would exceeding the 3 hours be ok and if so what would be a reasonable number above 3 be?	4	3	3	3	3.25

But now that I have gotten use to it, it's like a lot of new technology you can't live with out it. There is a very major down side to it though, in oder to make money you have to keep moving. You need to address the drivers time lost to loading and unloading. It is not right that a company holds a driver for hours at a time. Now this is illegal but trust me all drivers due it, they falsify thier log books to not show the time they sit doing these things. With EOBR you can not do this which is good, but it will cost drivers thousands of dollars in lost driving time.

I think this is what sets America apart from other countries because we can ship anything, anywhere very quickly. many times to move this type of freight quickly you can't comply with the current HOS but that doesn't mean you are endangering other people on the road.

Otherwise, airlines will bump passengers who paid a lower fare. As a result, for example, if I paid $200 for a ticket and a different passenger paid $800 for a seat on the same airplane and class of service, the airline would have a clear incentive to bump me and not the other passenger - all else equal. In addition, the airline should compensate the bumped individual for the time they wasted because the airline bumped them.

A wireless device that transmits driver stops is a truck hijackers dream come true. Even though the proposed EOBR does no record stops down to the GPS grid coordinate level, all a thief or theft ring needs to know is the city the truck stopped to have a good idea of what their cargo is. Shipping locations are well known within the trucking community. For example if a truck stops for more than a 1/2 hour and less than 10 hours in my home town there is a very high probability the truck is carrying bagged soil or bricks. The thieves know what towns the pharmaceuticals, electronics, precious metals (like copper, aluminum) and other high value loads are being shipped from. Several recommendations: A. DOT conduct a study to confirm the security of the information from unauthorized users. If a law enforcement officer can read it via wireless or plug-in information - it is not secure. If wireless networks were secure the DOD would not prohibit their use for sensitive communications. B. DOT conduct a study to determine the number of truck drivers who will be killed or injured due to criminal exploitation of the security vulnerabilities of the proposed EOBR system. C. If an upgrade in the systems is require to make them more secure, those costs need to be included in the cost of the proposal.	5	4	5	4	4.5

If the presence of peanut dust on an airliner is that risky to them, they know they shouldn't be flying. Despite what FAAN claims, there is no scientific data to support the idea that large numbers of people are dying from anaphylactic shock due to peanut allergies, or even that peanut allergies are on the rise through natural causes. Gullible parents telling their kids not to eat peanuts because they are or might be allergic causes needless anxiety for those children, and when they finally are exposed to peanuts or peanut dust, they end up having an allergy. That's irresponsible parenting. At the same time, most of the population is allergic to one or ore types of dust; should the FAA ban that from airliners, too? How would they accomplish that? They'd be unable to open the doors to board or disembark, and you'd have to close all the airports, too. Allergies are not disabilities. If that were true, then the 80 percent or more people who have a deviated septum would also qualify as having a disability, yet nobody's proposing that airlines supply a separate, non-emergency oxygen supply to help them breathe better. It's time to put an end to bending to the agenda of special interest groups that have a political agenda: one that isn't based on science, but instead based solely on fear and claims that can't be supported by scientific facts.	3	2	5	3	3.25

There should be no ""change fee"" charged to the consumer who turns down the airline's change to their itinerary and opts to re-book the flight. Way back in January I booked a flight to NC with very specific choices made to ensure that I had enough time between flights and that I arrived within a certain window of time. The airline proceeded to change my itinerary on three separate occasions, ultimately putting me on the flights I had specifically avoided when I booked the ticket. When I called to ask if I could re-book to meet my travel needs, I was told that the airline would charge me a change fee of ""at least"" $180, plus the difference in ticket price on that day.

At 9am, a gate agent advised maybe a 11am boarding (people who did not arrive till 10am per prior instruction never heard that announcement). After that NO ONE gave us status. It was 6pm before we found out the flight was canceled by calling the airlines. The notice on the departure boards and at the gate said ""delayed""... a gate agent never gave us status after 9am!

As I think about it, there are some serious communication issues with peanut-free zones or individual peanut-free flights. I have had flight times changed and the airline failed to email or telephone me. I caught the time change when I logged in to print a boarding pass. My brother almost missed a flight when the same thing happened to him. If a peanut-allergic person books a flight a short time before travel, the airlines are not reliable enough to notify passengers. The information could be provided when people log in to print boarding passes, but not everyone prints them in advance. The scenario where a celiac like me packs peanut-containing food and doesn't find out about a peanut restriction until they arrive at the airport is troublesome. Not all terminals have places where I can buy gluten-free food. Peanut-free zones on full flights could be handled by the flight staff moving people who want to eat peanuts around the cabin; however, people are sometimes resistant to being reseated and it puts a burden on the flight crew. As I write this, I think DOT is going to have to go with an all or none policy on peanuts.

Hard as this may be to believe not every one carries a cell phone or other pda. So airlines should, at the very minimum, continually update on their flight information screens throughout the airport and at the gate along with loud speaker updates at the gate area.

That being said,since they de-regulated trucking in the sixtys, the haul rate has been in a freefall. I would suggest, if they're going to require all this, that they should also re-regulate the haul rate. Just so we won't have to keep hauling dollar freight, and pay for all this other stuff too.

Perhaps instead of banning peanuts and peanut products outright. Airlines and the DOT can provide sufferers with HEPA airmasks which I assume will prevent individuals from inhaling peanut dust. I would think this approach would be of minimal cost (air filters can be bought for about $20 or less) and would not require a ban. If touch is a problem dressing accordingly (i.e. long clothes for the trip to minimize touching surfaces)can help decrease the amount. I would say that if someone still insists upon a ban if these measures would work that we are then getting into a debate of my rights over your rights and my want to be comfortable compared to your want to be comfortable which definitely takes us out of the need to protect life arena I think the government should do studies if they insist upon a ban and should not put one into effect without such a study.	5	4	5	3	4.25

I purchased some safe, gluten-free trail mix at the airport and tossed it into my carry-on so that I could have something to eat. It had dried fruit, nuts, and included peanuts. My concern was gluten, not peanuts. There was a child with a peanut allergy on the plane and not only did the flight crew refuse to serve peanuts to the entire plane, but I was asked to put away the gluten-free trail mix I had just bought IN THE AIRPORT. I would have eaten something else to keep my blood sugar up, but every single snack on that plane other than the peanuts contained gluten. I came off the three hour flight dizzy, sick, hypoglycemic, and furious. Why does one person's disability take precedence over another's? If DOT is going to restrict peanuts on planes it needs to be CLEARLY COMMUNICATED ON THE TICKET AND IN ADVANCE. It's easy to bring foods without peanuts but only if you know to do so.	4	4	4	0	3.0
